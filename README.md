# wplace.live Template Manager

An advanced template manager for wplace.live.

## Why does this exist?

The first template overlay for WPlace appeared almost instantly after WPlace went live. 
I immediately joined an alliance with a few of my friends and we were hyped! 
We installed Blue Marble, put our pixel arts through an online converter, and started pixeling.
But only a few pixels in, we already longed for features Blue Marble didn't provide. And that's where I stepped in.

In the meantime, another overlay by the name of "WPlace Overlay Pro" appeared. Not as well known as Blue Marble,
but way better in comparison. But I was already committed, and still have a few aces up my sleave.
With wplace.live Template Manager, names and coordinates are embedded in exported images, providing a seamless and
user-error-free importing experience. Also the ability to only show certain colors in the template overlay makes
working in groups and on bigger projects with many colors a breeze.
